  title={RW4T Dataset: Data of Human-Robot Behavior and Cognitive States in Simulated Disaster Response Tasks},
  author={Orlov Savko, L., and Qian, Z., and Gremillion, G., and Neubauer, C., and Canady, J., and Unhelkar, V.},
  abstract={To forge effective collaborations with humans, robots require the capacity to understand and predict the behaviors of their human counterparts. There is a growing body of computational research on human modeling for human-robot interaction (HRI). However, a key bottleneck in conducting this research is the relative lack of data of cognitive states -- like intent, workload, and trust -- which undeniably affect human behavior. Despite their significance, these states are elusive to measure, making the assembly of datasets a challenge and hindering the progression of human modeling techniques. To help address this, we first introduce Rescue World for Teams (RW4T): a configurable testbed to simulate disaster response scenarios requiring human-robot collaboration. Next, using RW4T, we curate a multimodal dataset of human-robot behavior and cognitive states in dyadic human-robot collaboration. This RW4T dataset includes state, action and reward sequences, and all the necessary data to replay a visual task execution. It further contains psychophysiological metrics like heart rate and pupillometry, complemented by self-reported cognitive state measures. With data from 20 participants, each undertaking five human-robot collaborative tasks, this dataset (comprising of 100 unique trajectories) accompanied with the simulator can serve as a valuable benchmark for human behavior modeling.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of accurate detection of known and emerging pathogens. However, robust characterization of pathogenic sequences remains an open challenge. To address this need we developed SeqScreen, which accurately characterizes short nucleotide sequences using taxonomic and functional labels and a customized set of curated Functions of Sequences of Concern (FunSoCs) specific to microbial pathogenesis. We show our ensemble machine learning model can label protein-coding sequences with FunSoCs with high recall and precision. SeqScreen is a step towards a novel paradigm of functionally informed synthetic DNA screening and pathogen characterization, available for download at www.gitlab.com/treangenlab/seqscreen.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
