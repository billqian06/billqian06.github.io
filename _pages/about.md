Hi, I am an undergraduate student at Rice University, and I will be continuing at Rice as a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science. I am part of the Human-Centered AI and Robotics Lab led by Prof. [Vaibhav Unhelkar](https://unhelkar.github.io/). My research interest lies in utilizing multimodal information (i.e. language and images) to help autonomous agents learn to perform tasks and better collaborate with humans.

Previously, I worked on characterizing the pathogenicity of short nucleotide sequences with machine learning at [Treangen Lab](https://www.treangenlab.com/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
